### 2.1 Architecture


<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />


The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.


Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.


**Main components of the architecture**


**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.


The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:


* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**


The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.


<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />


Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),


* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.


For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.


<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />


The sections below give more details of each component.


### 2.2 UI component


The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)


![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.


The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)


The `UI` component,


* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.


### 2.3 Logic component


**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)


Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:


<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>


The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.


![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>


How the `Logic` component works:


1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.


Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:


<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>


How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.


### 2.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)


<img src="images/UpdatedModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />




The `Model` component,


* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


The `Person` class is abstract and represents the common attributes shared by all people in the system (e.g., name, phone, email, address, note, cost, payment status, and tags).


Two concrete subclasses extend `Person`:


`Student` – represents a student, with an additional `Schedule` field indicating their availability or timetable.


`Parent` – represents a parent, who does not have a `Schedule` field.


This design allows the Model to handle shared logic through the abstract `Person` class while allowing each subtype (`Student` and `Parent`) to define their own specific properties and behaviors.


:bulb: **Design Rational:**
This class hierarchy improves extensibility and maintainability:


* Extensibility: Adding new person types (e.g., `Teacher`) only requires subclassing `Person`.


* Encapsulation: Each attribute type (e.g., Email, Note, Schedule) validates and encapsulates its own data.


* Reusability: Shared logic resides in `Person`, while subclass-specific logic resides in `Student` or `Parent`.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>


<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


</div>




### 2.5 Storage component


**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)


<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />


The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)


### 2.6 Common classes


Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **3. Implementation**


This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### 3.1 `schedule` Feature


**Purpose:**
Assigns weekly or date-specific lessons to a student.


**Key Classes:**
- `ScheduleCommand`
- `ScheduleCommandParser`
- `Student`
- `Schedule`

**Behaviour:**
- Accepts either a **day** (`Monday`–`Sunday`) or **date** (`MM-DD-YYYY`).
- Rejects times crossing midnight (e.g., `23:00-01:00`).
- Case and whitespace-insensitive.
- Replaces any existing schedule for that student.
- Only Students have a schedule


**Design Considerations**

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Store schedule as text | ✅ Yes | Simpler to serialize and display |
| Enforce unique schedule slots | ❌ No | Tutors may conduct concurrent classes |
| Support overnight lessons | ❌ No | Lessons assumed not to cross midnight |
|Can be modified through `edit` command |✅ Yes| Provide flexibility for users and maintain consistency


---


### 3.2 `list` Feature


**Purpose:**
Displays contacts filtered by payment or schedule.


**Supported commands:**
```
list
list paid
list unpaid
list schedule
list <DAY>
list <DATE>
```


**Key Classes:**
- `ListCommand`
- `ListCommandParser`
- `ModelManager`


**Design Highlights:**
- Filters the in-memory `FilteredList<Person>` based on the user’s argument.
- Accepts case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant input.
- Filter resets automatically after executing another command.


**Design Considerations**

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Persist filtered list | ❌ No | Filters should reset for predictability |
| Strict argument validation | ✅ Yes | Prevent invalid filters like `list abc` |


---



### 3.3 `paid` Feature



**Purpose:**
Toggles the payment status of a student or parent, ensuring the UI and derived aggregates stay in sync.



**Key Classes:**
- `PaidCommand`
- `PaidCommandParser`
- `ModelManager`
- `Student`
- `Parent`
- `PaymentStatus`

**Behaviour:**
- Supports toggling by index (e.g. `paid 1`) or by name (`paid n/Alex Yeoh`).
- When a **student** is toggled, only that student’s payment status is flipped.
- When a **parent** is toggled, every linked child is toggled to the same paid/unpaid state in a single command.
- Parents without linked children are rejected with a descriptive error.
- Success feedback is concise: `Marked as paid/unpaid: <Contact Name>`.
- Parent payment status is always derived from the state of their linked students.

**Design Considerations**

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Toggle parents independently from children | ❌ No | Would desynchronise parent/child statuses |
| Propagate parent toggle to all children | ✅ Yes | Keeps household records consistent with a single action |
| Allow toggling parents without children | ❌ No | Prevents ambiguous states when no data is available |
| Recompute aggregates on every mutation | ✅ Yes | Ensures UI, storage, and business logic remain consistent |

---

### 3.4 `link` / `unlink` Features




**Purpose:**
Creates and removes relationships between a `Parent` and one or more `Students`.


**Key Classes:**
- `LinkCommand`
- `UnlinkCommand`
- `LinkCommandParser`
- `UnlinkCommandParser`
- `ModelManager`
- `Person`, `Parent`, `Student`

**Behaviour:**
- `link` establishes a bidirectional relationship: both the parent and the student reference each other.
- `unlink` removes the relationship from both entities simultaneously.
- Only valid parent-student pairs are allowed; attempts to link two parents or two students are rejected.
- Multiple parents can be linked to a single student, and vice versa.
- Linking an already linked pair has no effect but gives a descriptive message.
- Unlinking a non-existent relationship gives a descriptive error.
- Changes are immediately reflected in the GUI and persisted in the JSON storage.

**Design Considerations**

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| One-way relationship | ❌ No | Retrieval would require redundant searches |
| Store by index | ✅ Yes | Avoids heavy identifier management |
| Allow multiple parents per student | ✅ Yes | Supports real-world family structures |
| Allow multiple students per parent | ✅ Yes | Supports siblings sharing the same parent |
| Validate link/unlink actions | ✅ Yes | Prevents invalid or redundant operations |


---


### 3.5 `reset all` Feature

**Purpose:**
Resets payment status of all contacts (Students and Parents) to unpaid with a single command.

**Key Classes:**
- `ResetAllCommand`
- `ResetAllCommandParser`
- `Model`
- `Person`, `Student`, `Parent`

**Behaviour:**
- Accepts only the exact phrase `reset all`.
- Rejects any other variants (e.g., `reset`, `reset payments`).
- Iterates through all contacts and updates each payment to unpaid.
- Works for both Students and Parents.
- Shows message if no contacts exist.


**Design Considerations**

| Option                                           | Decision | Reason                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allow partial reset (e.g., only unpaid students) | ❌ No | Ensures predictable behaviour with clarity.                       |
| Accept variants or extra tokens                  | ❌ No | Prevents accidental mass resets and stays consistent |

### 3.6 `pay/` (Cost) Field

**Purpose:**
Captures the per-lesson fee for students and automatically aggregates the total cost for parents.

**Key Classes:**
- `Cost`
- `AddCommand`
- `EditCommand`
- `ParserUtil`
- `ModelManager`
- `Student`
- `Parent`

**Behaviour:**
- `pay/` accepts positive integers or decimal values (e.g. `pay/72.5`).
- Students can have their cost set during `add` or updated via `edit`.
- Parent costs are immutable from the UI—the value is always the sum of their linked children.
- Model recalculations occur automatically after every add, edit, delete, link, or payment toggle.
- Costs display with a leading `$` in the UI for readability.

**Design Considerations**

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Store cost as raw string | ✅ Yes | Simplifies parsing and avoids floating-point drift |
| Allow parents to set custom costs | ❌ No | Prevents mismatch between parent and child totals |
| Auto-recalculate on relevant commands | ✅ Yes | Guarantees derived values stay correct without user action |
| Permit zero or missing child costs | ✅ Yes | Some students may not yet have agreed rates |

## **5. Appendix: Requirements**


### 5.1 Product scope


**Target user profile**:


Primary users:
* Private tutors (individuals, not agencies).
* Tutors who handle multiple students and parents.
* Users who prefer typing-first commands (efficient over GUI clicks).
* Tech-comfortable but not professional programmers.


Pain points:
* Managing multiple students’ details, parents’ contacts, schedules, and payments across scattered platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, notebooks, Excel).
* Losing time on administrative tasks instead of teaching.


**Value proposition**: TutorHub provides a fast, typing-first address book tailored for tutors. It streamlines student and parent information, schedules, and payment tracking so tutors spend less time managing data and more time teaching.
